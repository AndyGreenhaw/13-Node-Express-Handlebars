## Description

The Burger App is a program that enables users to generate a burger of their choice and then devour it.

## Installation

To install the application, visit the GitHub account at the link included at the bottom of this README and clone it to your directory. Run npm init, npm install, and then you will be able to run the program using the command node index.js.

## Usage

To start the application, run the command "node index.js" in your terminal in the root area of the Burger App folder structure. Then open your browser and enter the URL  http://localhost:3013. Here you will see a list of burgers already added to the burger table, which you can choose to devour. You can add a new burger by entering a name into the input field and clicking submit. You can then devour the burger you created by clicking "Devour."
